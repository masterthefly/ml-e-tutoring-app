## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Enhanced System Flow
```
Student Question → Complexity Analysis → Model Selection → AWS Bedrock → Response
     ↓                    ↓                   ↓              ↓           ↓
Cache Check → Simple/Medium/Complex → Haiku/Sonnet/Opus → Native AWS → Cached
```

### AWS Integration Benefits
- **Native CloudWatch monitoring** with detailed metrics
- **X-Ray tracing** for performance optimization  
- **Auto-scaling** with AWS infrastructure
- **Multi-region deployment** capabilities
- **Disaster recovery** with AWS backup services

## 🛠️ Implementation Highlights

### **Intelligent Complexity Detection**
```typescript
// Automatic model selection based on question analysis
const complexity = analyzeQuestionComplexity(question);
const model = selectOptimalModel(complexity);
// Routes to most cost-effective model for the task
```

### **Enhanced Conversation Context**
```typescript
// Better context handling for educational continuity
const context = await getConversationHistory(sessionId, 5);
const response = await bedrock.generateResponse(question, grade, context);
```

### **Real-time Cost Tracking**
```typescript
// Track costs and performance in real-time
const metrics = {
    tokensUsed: response.tokensUsed,
    modelUsed: response.model,
    responseTime: response.responseTime,
    estimatedCost: calculateCost(response.tokensUsed, response.model)
};
```
