# ML-E Tutoring App

ML-E (pronounced "Melly") is a production-ready, multi-agentic AI web application designed to teach fundamental Machine Learning concepts to high school students (9th-10th grade) through an interactive, chat-based interface with advanced error handling and system resilience.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+) 
- MongoDB (running locally)
- Redis (running locally)
- OpenAI API Key

### Get Running in 3 Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**
   ```bash
   # Edit backend/.env and add:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Access:** http://localhost:3000 (Frontend) | http://localhost:3001/api (Backend)

## Core Interfaces

The system is built around several key interfaces:

### Agent System
- **AgentState**: Manages individual agent state and capabilities
- **AgentMessage**: Handles communication between agents
- **CoordinationRequest**: Orchestrates multi-agent interactions

### User Management
- **User**: Student user profiles with preferences
- **LearningSession**: Conversation and learning state management
- **StudentProgress**: Learning progress tracking and analytics

### Content System
- **MLTopic**: Machine learning topics and curriculum structure
- **Exercise**: Interactive learning exercises and assessments
- **ConceptExample**: Real-world examples and explanations

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- MathJax for mathematical notation
- D3.js for data visualization

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- TypeScript for type safety
- Socket.io for WebSocket support
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Redis for session management
- JWT for authentication

### Multi-Agent System
- Coordinator Agent: Orchestrates agent interactions
- Tutor Agent: Provides educational content delivery
- Assessment Agent: Evaluates student understanding
- Content Agent: Generates adaptive learning materials

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies for all packages:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. Copy environment files and configure:
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   ```

3. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 3001) in development mode.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build all packages for production
- `npm run lint` - Run linting across all packages
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Requirements Addressed

This project structure addresses the following requirements:
- **1.1**: Chat interface foundation with real-time communication setup
- **5.1**: Multi-agent system architecture with proper interfaces
- **6.1**: Responsive web interface structure with accessibility considerations
