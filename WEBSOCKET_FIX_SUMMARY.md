# WebSocket Connection Stability Fix

## Issues Resolved

### 1. JWT Signature Mismatch
**Problem:** WebSocket authentication was failing with "invalid signature" error
**Root Cause:** Auth service and WebSocket service were using different default JWT secrets
**Solution:** 
- Updated both services to use the same JWT secret from environment variables
- Ensured consistent fallback values: `ml-e-super-secret-jwt-key-for-development-only-change-in-production-2024`

### 2. Redis Connection Errors
**Problem:** WebSocket service was crashing when trying to store messages in Redis
**Root Cause:** Redis was not installed/running, causing unhandled exceptions
**Solution:**
- Added graceful error handling for Redis operations
- Changed error logging from `logger.error` to `logger.warn` for Redis failures
- Ensured WebSocket continues working even without Redis persistence

### 3. Event Name Mismatch
**Problem:** Frontend and backend were using different WebSocket event names
**Root Cause:** Frontend was sending `send-message` but backend expected `chat:message`
**Solution:**
- Updated frontend to use correct event names:
  - Send: `chat:message` (with `message` property)
  - Listen: `chat:message`, `chat:typing`
- Fixed session joining to use `session:join` event

### 4. Message Duplication
**Problem:** User messages were appearing twice in the chat
**Root Cause:** Frontend was adding user message locally AND backend was echoing it back
**Solution:**
- Removed local message addition in frontend
- Let backend handle all message echoing for consistency

### 5. Connection Stability
**Problem:** WebSocket connections were dropping unexpectedly
**Solution:**
- Added heartbeat mechanism (every 30 seconds)
- Improved error handling in message handlers
- Enhanced reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Increased connection timeout to 20 seconds

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/src/services/auth.service.ts` - Fixed JWT secret consistency
- `backend/src/services/websocket.service.ts` - Added error handling, heartbeat, stability improvements

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/hooks/useChat.ts` - Fixed event names and message handling
- `frontend/src/services/websocket.service.ts` - Added heartbeat support and improved reconnection

## Test Results

✅ WebSocket authentication working  
✅ Message sending/receiving working  
✅ Agent responses working  
✅ Connection stability maintained  
✅ Graceful handling of Redis unavailability  
✅ Proper error handling and logging  

## Current Status

The WebSocket connection is now stable and the chat functionality works correctly:
1. User can login successfully
2. WebSocket connects and authenticates properly
3. Messages are sent and received correctly
4. Agent responses are generated and delivered
5. Connection remains stable during use
6. System gracefully handles Redis being unavailable

## Usage

Both frontend (http://localhost:3000) and backend (http://localhost:3001) are running.
Users can now chat with the ML-E system without connection drops or authentication issues.
